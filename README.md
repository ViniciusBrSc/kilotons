# Kilotons of CO2

The goal of this project is to transform a CSV to Parquet, then to clean and analyse data about CO2 emissions by many countries from 1990 to 2019.

The raw dataset in CSV was loaded and saved as Parquet file using standard commands available in Pandas. Also, the processed dataset was saved as Parquet after data cleaning with Jupyter Notebook.
